The Jenkins Continuous Integration and Delivery server [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins).

This is a fully functional Jenkins server.

# Usage

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --restart=on-failure jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17
```

NOTE: read the section [_Connecting agents_](#connecting-agents) below for the role of the `50000` port mapping.
NOTE: read the section [_DNS Configuration_](#dns-configuration) in case you see the message "This Jenkins instance appears to be offline." 

This will store the workspace in `/var/jenkins_home`.
All Jenkins data lives in there - including plugins and configuration.
You will probably want to make that an explicit volume so you can manage it and attach to another container for upgrades :

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --restart=on-failure -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17
```

This will automatically create a 'jenkins_home' [docker volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) on the host machine.
Docker volumes retain their content even when the container is stopped, started, or deleted.

NOTE: Avoid using a [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) from a folder on the host machine into `/var/jenkins_home`, as this might result in file permission issues (the user used inside the container might not have rights to the folder on the host machine).
If you _really_ need to bind mount jenkins_home, ensure that the directory on the host is accessible by the jenkins user inside the container (jenkins user - uid 1000) or use `-u some_other_user` parameter with `docker run`.

```
docker run -d -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 --restart=on-failure jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk17
```
